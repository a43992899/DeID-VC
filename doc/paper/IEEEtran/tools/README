The IEEEtrantools.sty package provides several commands from the
IEEEtran.cls file so that they can be used under other LaTeX classes. The
user guide provided here covers only the differences in the use of the
commands from those provided by IEEEtran.cls. For complete documentation
on these commands, see the relevant sections in the IEEEtran_HOWTO manual
of the IEEEtran LaTeX class.

The IEEEtrantools.sty package provides the following IEEEtran.cls commands:

 1. \IEEEPARstart which produces large initial "drop cap" letters.
 2. the \bstctlcite command for the control entry types of IEEEtran.bst
    V1.00 and later
 3. the IEEE itemize, enumerate and description list environments
 4. the complete IEEEeqnarray family for producing multiline equations
    as well as matrices and tables, including the IEEEeqnarray support
    commands.

IEEEtrantools.sty should not be used with IEEEtran.cls.

*******
1/2007 V1.2 (V1.7 of IEEEtran.cls) changes:

 1. Several commands and enviroments have depreciated in favor of
    replacements with IEEE prefixes to better avoid potential future name
    clashes with other packages. Legacy code retained to allow use of the
    obsolete forms, but with an warning message to the console during
    compilation:
    \IEEEPARstart
    For IED lists:
    \IEEEiedlabeljustifyc, \IEEEiedlabeljustifyl, \IEEEiedlabeljustifyr,
    \IEEEnocalcleftmargin, \IEEElabelindent, \IEEEsetlabelwidth,
    \IEEEusemathlabelsep
 
 2. These commands/lengths now require the IEEE prefix and do not have
    legacy support: \IEEEnormaljot.
    For IED lists: \ifIEEEnocalcleftmargin, \ifIEEEnolabelindentfactor,
    \IEEEiedlistdecl, \IEEElabelindentfactor

 3. \normalsizebaselineskip no longer provided. 

 4. New \IEEEPARstart controls:
    \IEEEPARstartHEIGHTTEXT, \IEEEPARstartFONTSTYLE, \IEEEPARstartCAPSTYLE,
    \IEEEPARstartWORDFONTSTYLE, \IEEEPARstartWORDCAPSTYLE,
    \IEEEPARstartHOFFSET, \IEEEPARstartITLCORRECT
    and the (output) length \IEEEPARstartletwidth.

 5. Provide for an optional argument to \bstctlcite to provide a way to
    specify a different aux file. Define \bstctlcite even if it has already
    been defined.
