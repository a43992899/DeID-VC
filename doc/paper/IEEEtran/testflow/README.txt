This is the "testflow" diagnostic suite which is designed to test LaTeX
"print work flow" and to provide lots of helpful information to assist
users in getting their LaTeX system configured and/or upgraded in order
to produce good PS/PDF output.

Although originally designed for IEEEtran users, testflow will be of
interest to anyone who uses LaTeX to make PostScript or PDF output.

Extensive usage documentation is contained in "testflow_doc.pdf"

The control test reference files are available in both PostScript and PDF,
each in A4 and US Letter paper sizes.


For helpful tips, answers to frequently asked questions and other support,
